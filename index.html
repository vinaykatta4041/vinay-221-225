        <p>training; equipment; delivery; student performance) with their benefits, and
concluded that TVI offered the best alternative.<br>
SOBAM faculty set these goals for this initial TVI program:<br>
•    To enhance the “international perspectives” of the faculty;<br>
•    To increase the faculty’s experience with executive education;<br>
•    To learn a distance learning technology;<br>
•    To improve the overall “quality” of our graduate students; and<br>
•    To gain experience in developing and delivering an in-house program on
a cohort basis (i.e., the same group of students take the same courses
throughout their educational program).</p>
        <h2><b>Initial Program Characteristics</b></h2>
        <p>The first TVI program began in 1990 with China Resources Holding
Company (CRC), a private company owned by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the People’s Republic of China and headquartered in Hong Kong.
CRC hired a local coordinator who assisted SOBAM faculty in identifying
100 of the CRC mid-career managers who were interested in pursuing a MBA
degree, whose English skills were sufficient, who had undergraduate degrees,
and whose superiors would support these efforts. Before being admitted into
the program, the SOBAM Associate Dean and the Program Coordinator
interviewed each applicant. Before admittance, each prospective student was
given math and English exams to determine their proficiencies with basic
skills. The initial class consisted of thirty-six executives. Each student
remained fully employed (i.e., on a full-time basis) during the program.<br>
Two local tutors were hired and trained (by the SOBAM Associate Dean)
in discussion-generating techniques. Each was a young executive of the
company whose English language skills permitted him or her to lead a
discussion in this language. Both tutors had limited management experience
and, therefore, would be unable to answer questions on the technical issues
included within the specific topical areas covered by the MBA courses.</p>
        <h2><b>Accreditation</b></h2>
        <p>At this time, the University was conducting its self-study as required for
reaccreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).
Since this program was a substantial deviation from the normal form of
educational delivery, the SOBAM dean decided that it would be prudent to
file an addendum to the self-study report that focused on the proposed distance
education program. Upon consultation, it was decided that:<br>
(1) The CRC MBA program would consist of exactly the same courses and
course sequence as that required for on-campus students;<br>(2) To insure that the CRC students were equally served by the program in
Hong Kong, the CRC program coordinator would become a SOBAM
faculty member;<br>
(3) SOBAM faculty would be required to use a common final examination
in order to evaluate the TVI students directly against those on-campus
students whose classes were being videotaped; and<br>
(4) “Live instruction” would be one-third of the total program.<br>
The American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)
also accredits the SOBAM. This organization has no specific accreditation
issues regarding distance education program. Further, since the average age
of the first cohort was 36, it was apparent from the research that the regular
MBA admissions “screening” device, the Graduate Management Aptitude
Test (GMAT), would have limited value.</p>
        <h2><b>Program Delivery</b></h2>
        <p>CRC students attended two MBA video viewings and discussions on
one night per week and on Saturday during a 10-week academic session
in a room specially designed for videotape viewing at the company’s
training center in Hong Kong. At a typical session, the tutor would start
and stop the videotape if questions were raised, and upon completion of
that session’s videotaped materials would then conduct a discussion
formed around questions supplied by the course’s instructor. Faculty
submitted discussion questions for their tutors and required formal weekly
feedback from the tutor via fax. Further, a formal faculty “feedback”
mechanism was established in the form of a videotaped interview with
each of the faculty who taught in the program (thereby permitting faculty
who would be teaching in the TVI program for the first time to “get on the
learning curve” quickly).<br>
Each set of TVI faculty was flown to Hong Kong to spend 12 “live”
contact hours with the students over a 6-day period. Visiting faculty used
the mornings and afternoons for “live classes,” and held these classes in
the same classrooms regularly used by the students to meet and view the
videotapes. Each faculty member was encouraged to personally evaluate
the work of the students while he/she was engaged in the “live” portion of
the course. These “live” sessions were scheduled at the end of each course
to permit the faculty to be onsite for the required final exam. (In the later
cohorts these “live” sessions were moved to the middle of each course
because the students preferred earlier-in-the-course direct contact with
the faculty.) On a routine basis, the tutor collected the course assignments
and sent them to the instructor for evaluation. The Program Coordinatoradministered the quizzes, midterm examinations, and case analysis discussions on-site and sent the materials to the instructor for grading.<br>
The on-campus classes that were videotaped for subsequent viewing
in Hong Kong were held in a small, windowless room located in the
University’s instructional media complex, where no more than 16 MBA
students could be wedged into the available space. Two students could use
a small video monitor mounted on the table in front of them if they wanted
to see what the instructor was writing on a pad (which was being
videotaped via on overhead projector). Microphones were placed between
each two students so that both the student’s questions and the instructor’s
responses were captured on the videotape.</p>
        <h2><b>Subsequent Programs</b></h2>
        <p>The first CRC cohort graduated in 1993, the second in 1996, and the third
class graduated in 1999. For the second and third CRC cohorts, separate
classes, both videotape viewing and “live,” were held for executives working
in Beijing and Hong Kong. In 1993, the University contracted with a second
Hong Kong-based firm, Guangdong Enterprises (GD), to deliver a TVI MBA
program to their mid-career executives who were working at three different
locations in Guangdong (Canton) Province and in adjacent Hong Kong. The
first GD class graduated in 1997, and a second class graduated in 2000. [For
purposes of discussion, we have identified these groups as CRC1, CRC2,
CRC3, GD1, and GD2.]</p>
        <h2><b>An Interim Evaluation</b></h2>
        <p>After completing the CRC1 program, an analysis of the student evaluations of the TVI courses was undertaken. Several significant technical
problems (e.g., poor quality video; inability to hear student questions or
comments) were identified. Further, the Chinese students clearly preferred
more “live time” with the faculty. To accommodate these concerns the
amount of on-site live instruction time was increased from 12 to 15 hours.
New overhead cameras, additional microphones, and more powerful “multidirectional” microphones were installed so that TVI students were better able
to see more clearly what the instructor was trying to illustrate and to hear
“live” student responses. The videotaping was moved to a much larger
classroom. The addition of a third camera permitted coverage of students as
they asked questions or responded to the faculty. Faculty were encouraged to
post their email addresses on their TVI course syllabi, to supply copies of all
materials distributed to the “live” students, to make better use of the tutor, and
to prepare separate course schedules to coincide with the videotape viewing
schedules of their TVI students.</p>
        <p>In 1996, the SOBAM faculty undertook a formal evaluation of the
faculty’s experiences with the TVI programs (Murray, 1996). By this time, the
first CRC1 cohort had completed the MBA program and both CRC2 and GD1
were in progress. SOBAM faculty:<br>
• Felt that the TVI technology and the enhanced email-based feedback
loop was not working; i.e., the students were not getting full value from
their TVI experiences;<br>
• Desired to have even more “live” time with their TVI students;<br>
• Had not used a common final examination or any other means that would
permit a direct comparison of the academic performances of their TVI
and “live” students;<br>
• Were not using the tutor for feedback purposes or were not providing
directions for the tutor<br>
• Were unhappy with the overall quality of the Hong Kong students
efforts, as evidenced by their grades on exams, student projects, papers,
case analyses and presentations, and written work in general; e.g.,
grammar, spelling, and syntax; and<br>
• Felt that despite these problems the overall TVI experience was a
rewarding one for themselves and their Hong Kong students.<br>
TVI student evaluations continued to note both continued technical
difficulties and renewed requests for more “live” time in place of TVI (Murray
& Efendioglu, 1999).</p>
<center><h1><b>A LONGITUDAL STUDY OF PERFORMANCE
AND EFFECTIVENESS</b></h1></center>
        <p>In 1997, a formal survey of current and past CRC and GD students was
initiated. Thirteen (36%) of the 36 students enrolled in the CRC1 program, the
first TVI MBA cohort, responded to the survey. 13 (39%) of the 33 students
enrolled in CRC2, 20 (59%) of the 34 GD1 cohorts, 28 (74%) of the GD2
cohort, and 24 (72%) of the CRC3 cohort, responded to a formal attitudinal
survey. By 2000, it was possible to compare the results of the attitudinal
surveys, grades, and the means of the student evaluations to see if there were
significant differences that were due to the different instructional methodologies across all five TVI cohorts.<br>
Because of the prior research on TVI, we expected these adult learners
would perform better when compared to the students taking these same
classes on a “live” basis (Moore 1989). Further, we expected that overall the
TVI students would judge their educational experiences to be at least comparable to that those who were being educated on a “live” basis (Wilkes
and Burnham, 1991). Therefore, we formed the following hypotheses:<br>
H1
: Student performance in TVI courses would be superior to “live” courses<br>
H2
: Students rate their TVI experiences as at least as effective as
“live” instruction<br>
H3
: There would be no differences in TVI effectiveness between
subject areas.</p>
        <h2><b>Student Performance</b></h2>
        <p>As shown in Table 1 below, TVI students received slightly lower average
grades, 3.37 vs. 3.43 (calculated on a 4-point scale), as compared to the
average grade received by the MBA student that participated in the “live”
videotaped class. On the average, both the TVI and corresponding “live”
students received the highest grades in the environment/law MBA classes and
performed least well in economics courses. In performance, “live” students
received significantly higher grades in environment/law, communications,
MIS, management and marketing while, TVI students out-performed the
corresponding “live” students in accounting classes. It was not possible to
obtain the grades for the students whose classes were videotaped for CRC1,
so that information is not listed in this table.</p>
        <h2><b>Student Course Evaluations</b></h2>
        <p>The TVI students were asked to fill out a specially adapted student course
evaluation form at the end of each course. The results of these evaluations
were then summarized into three categories: course content, technology
(tapes and taping process), and the “live” teaching component of the course.</p>
